        <p id="welcome">Welcome!</p>        
        <p id="introduction">I am Angely, a 14-year-old student of Liger Leadership Academy. I was born in Kratie, but I grow up in Phnom Penh, Capital City of Cambodia.  
                I see Liger not as a school, but my second family that we grow up together as amazing people and learners. Liger is a place that has real impacts on my life and who I am. At Liger, I am travelling on my way from who I was and who I will become as a positive change agent. Love, Respect, Caring, Optimism and Kindness are essential qualities that I learned to display in daily life in order to build a peaceful community.  
                Science, Reading, Travelling, Learning and trying new things are my main passions. I am a curious person who likes to explore about interesting things especially science and astronomy. Reading helps me understand the world better and develop my positive thinking. Besides these passions, I also love listening to music to brighten up my daily life. In the future, I hope to be a photo-journalist and open up my own businesses. I want to travel the world and have my own adventures. I hope my future will be full of new learning experiences. 
                Enjoy reading this website to know more about me!</p>
