                                                was a tremendous opportunity for me to study about programming Robotics
                                                and especially researching about scientific problems. I got a chance to

                                                        In this project, I got to listen to all of the stories in four communities in Kampong Speu province. After gathering all of the stories,
                                                        we started to document them in different forms, pictures, writings, videos and podcasts. When we brought these products and showed them to the community, 
                                                        the villagers were really empowered by how their voices can be portrayed by those documentaries.

                                                        Species are going extinct, why? A huge part of this polution is Plastics. To study more about plastics and sollutions we

                                        electrical devices for an education organizations. This project aim is to help support the rural education by securing

                                        Therefore, I and other students initiated the Cambodian Geography Book that is currently on sales and contributed to government schools
                                        across the countries for students to read. We worked tirelessly for 2 years from interviewing people, to editing the content and 
                                        editing those informations into an engaging book. I am proud of being a part of this project for it will inspire other students to see the beauty of their country.</p>
