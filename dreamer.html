        <p style="margin-top: 100px;"> My dream is to foster great Skills, Passions and Knowledge for young students in Cambodia.
         I believe they have great potential to change the world around them with their curiosity and skills. In a developing country,
        a great force we need is the human resources. Therefore, education for young people is the key to changing our country's future. 

        Just like I was trusted in by Liger Leadership Academy to be a change agent, I want to continue this great spirits on to those capable childrens. 
        I was just like them, until I found a place that my passions spark. In the future, I want those children to find their light, too. 

         That is why my dream is to invest in those future leaders who needs help embracing their potential.

        <p> Entrepreneurship and Technology is the fields that has greatly inspire me and make me believe in a greater future. 
            After joining competitions like Technovation Girls, First Lego League Robotics competitions and events like Barcamp, My dreams
            now lies with these fields even more. 
        </p>

        <p> I imagine, what if there is a place where all entrepreneurs come to work together, build innovative solutions and design creative
            products to help humanity develop in a generation that needs help the most?
        </p>

        <p>
            What if you work in a place with ideas radiating around the room? With people, resources and companies who are there to help you?
            This lead me to dream of creating a working space, where innovation comes to work, ideas come together to create a bigger change in the world.
