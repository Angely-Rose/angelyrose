            <p class="margintopspace" style="margin-left: 30px;"> I am a second-cohort student learning in the Liger Leadership Academy.
                    Liger is a project-based learning school that provides full scholarship to 110 students from all over Cambodia. 
                    The main type of project we do here is called <b>exploration</b>. Exploration is a seven-weeks project that enhances many skills including 
                   researching, communication and networking, problem-solving, and especially the change-agent characteristics.</p>

                    This is my fourth year at Liger and this is also my First year of High School, too. I really love all of the classes,
                    projects and explorations at Liger. Those classes are my inspiration because of the creativity, especially it gives me a chance
                    to connect with the country I want to change.

                    In Literacy, I really like
                        expressing my voices and tell my stories in poetries and writings, for I believe that words can positively 
                        change many lives and encourage the minds and souls of people. I have been passionated in writing
                        ever since I was exposed to the great forms and impacts of poetries and writings. Creative Writing always
                        gives me the chance to escape to other world, create new lenses for readers so they can expand their knowledge and imagination.

                    Entrepreneurship is an incredible inspiration for me because of the great ambitions, lessons-learned from failures and the 
                    imense determination entrepreneurs display to acheive their goals. I believe it can bring more and more innovative and creative
                    solutions needed for our society. I believe it can change the world for the better, helping more and more lives who are in need. 
                    I believe that the revolution brought by entrepreneurship will positively benefit the world for the better.

                    Since I was a child, exploring the world of Science, Physics, Astronomy, Chemistry, Biology and other brances of Science
                    has always been intriguing to me. Science shows us everything, from the explanation of our existence to the explanation
                    of the endless vast universe we are in. I believe science can light the path for humanity, leading it to a clearer future.
