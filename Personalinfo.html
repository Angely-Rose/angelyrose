                    Hi beautiful readers out there! Below are my personal information that can help you to know me better: </p>
                <p class="subtitles">Birthday and Hometown</p>   

                <p>
                        I was born on the 5th of October, 2005 (National Teachers Day) in Kratie Province. My hometown is right beside the Mekong River that flows through many countries in Southeast
                        Asia.

    Chhlong District, My Origin
    </p>
    <p>
        My Hometown is a quiet and peaceful community. Most people there work as farmers because the delta land
        near the river is great for all kinds of agriculture. The common crops are smoking weeds, rice, corns and other crops. My hometown is a part of my identity, and I am 
        proud to be born in such a peaceful community with such authentic lifestyles. The stories of Chhlong district will always inspire me and make me remember my origin.

    <p>
        Loves of my life: Getting lost in fantasies books and movies, Working in the cafe, Iced Chocolate with cream powder and all the other things Chocolate!. 
        My favorite food is spicy Tom-Yum. I love joining MUN Conference, TED Talks, and all the other events that I can try new things, learn and develop as a person. 
        Animals that I can't resist are Rabbits and all the other furry animals. I wouldn't be me without music. I mostly listen to pop, indie-folk and country. I 
        have a lot of favorite artists, but my most favorite ones are Taylor Swift, James Arthur, Ed Sheeran. A day watching my favorite TV series and movies is my ideal perfect day. 
        My favorite movies are <i>Cool Runnings</i> <i>Matilda</i> <i>The Matrix</i> <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> <i>District 9</i> <i>Freedom Writers</i> and countless more! My favorite TV series of all time is THE FLASH!! 
            He is my favorite super hero. (Don't tell anyone, but I secretly wish I could have the Flash's superpower someday. I hope there'll be a particle accelerator will be invented someday.)

        Things I wish did not exist: I hate snakes, geckos, lizards and more animals. I secretly hate milk but I still try to drink it. 
        I hate the sound of styrofoam or high places. I am scared of the mysterious deepness of the ocean. Omeletes are my least favorite 
        food of all times!
