                <p class="quote">Reading is a big part of who I am. Whenever people ask me to describe myself, I would always tell them that I love reading, that I see the words shine in my heart and give me power and positivity. Stories encourage me to continue doing what I believe is right. Stories help me to find my voice through its voices. Stories tell me that the world has its own beauty and life has its true meaning. It challenges me to continue my journey on with strength. </p>

                <div class="poemdiv">
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            There is a quote from Nelson Mandela who is the former president of South Africa: “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world”. This quote is really true and that is the reason why all children deserve the right and access to quality education. Unfortunately, According to the United Nations Sustainable Development website, Over 265 million children are currently out of school and 22% of them are of primary school age. One of the main reasons for lack of quality education is that some developing countries are having the struggle to give every single child the access to quality tutoring due to poverty and other emergencies that the countries need to handle. Furthermore, the need for quality teaching caused by the lack of well-trained tutors, inequality problems related to the opportunity provided to rural children and girls, and the impoverished conditions of schools (United Nations.org). However, I firmly consider education as a prominent right that all children must have.  Although education requires a lot of money and time, every single child that is in the age of going to school must have access to and the right to education. Education for a young child is extremely crucial for helping to empower individuals and help them to reach their own potential, reducing poverty, and benefits future economic growth.  
                            Although education depends heavily upon inclusive finance, offering education to the young generation can reduce poverty in the impoverished community. To demonstrate, in many developing countries, poverty is one of the main problems that people are dealing with. Poverty is the state of extreme sufficient in the financial field. The problem is that the shortage of money can affect and lead to other problems including low access to education, clean water, and nutrition, hunger, etc. However, by offering adequate tutoring to children, it can reduce poverty and give many benefits to our society in nearly all aspects which is the key to sustainable development. Villa Kulid, Director General of Norad, gave a speech about education and how it can help to reduce poverty as well as other problems. He included that, “One year of education is associated with a 10% increase in wages”. (Kulid) This fact shows that education has a huge power to enlarge the wages of the workers. Education can boost incomes for citizens and giving the consequence of dwindled poverty. He also added that “A newly published paper by UNESCO shows that education is critical to escape chronic poverty and to prevent the transmission of poverty between generations.” This statement has clearly demonstrated that education is a major factor to decrease poverty in different generations and communities. Education has the power to let individuals find their potential and help their community, boosting incomes and decrease poverty. 
                            What’s more, it also helps with the employment within the country as well. In fact, the employment rates in different countries are based on the education levels of their citizens (data.oecd.org, 2018). In conclusion, education is needed in order to create a prosperous economy in a country. 
                        By delivering education access to children, it gives them a huge opportunity to find their potential, dreams, and talents which they will live upon and pursue further throughout their lives. To put it in another way, Education has the capability of empowering individuals and gives them the chance to reach their greatest potential which can help to reduce inequality in society. After they have their talents, they can pursue a career that can further support their communities and countries. A great example of that is a Pakistani teacher named Mohammud Ayub that commit his life teaching other people the basic subjects including math, English, etc. He is a Pakistani scholar that used his knowledge to spread and help his community. He has made a big difference in each student’s life that he taught and the community around him. (Associated Press and Newsela Staff) In addition, the process of education that includes many subjects including Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math will give a guidance for student’s passion, prepare them for obstacles and improve student’s critical thinking skills. In scmp.com, UChicago professor says that STEM help to prepare students for the future that awaits. Education in schools is imperative for children to find their passions, potentials, and talents which can reduce inequality and lead to sustainable developments in communities. 
                        In conclusion, Education for children is an essential field for development in each country though it requires money and time. In addition, it helps to reduce inequality, poverty, boost the prosperity of the economy, and empowers those individual children who are educated to help their community and society back. By offering the right and access to quality education for children, it is a huge profit for everyone at nearly all aspects, including the community, country, family, and individuals. Therefore, the right and access to quality education is exceedingly an important right that every and single child around the globe deserve to have in spite of any conditions or situations that they are under. There are a lot of works to be done in order to help all children in the world to gain access to quality education.

                        I’m from screws and nails, from frying pans and sunflower oil. 

                        I’m from the swings and toys that laid next to the sweet small house, the most vivid memory of my childhood.
                        I ’m from the green leaves that made those oily potions. 
                        The river tamarind trees whose seeds I can still taste on my tongue. 
                        
                        I’m from the sticky rice cakes made during Phchum Ben and the white shirts and silk skirts in pagodas, from my mom and grandma. 
                        
                        I’m from the sweat that drops down my grandfather’s neck and the neighbor’s old bike that gave me that scar on my left ankle. 
                        
                        I’m from the quick-moving hands my mother has when she sews and gives the grade to her students. 
                        
                        I’m from write with your right hand! And Where’s your book? And those old songs my mother put...
                        
                        I’m from the hard-working days and endless efforts in those farming fields
                        
                        I’m from the dolphin province, and the warm, welcoming village
                        
                        I’m from the sweet egg drink and dried, salty cucumbers
                        
                        I’m from the brave people on the wall of my grandmother’s house, whose faces are identical to my mom. 
                        
                        I’m from the tale of my grandfather’s bravery whose name became part of mine and face I only remember from an old picture. 
                        
                        The legs my family run for their lives_
                        The wishes they  prayed for the chance to live
                        The big wooden house which their souls still linger on
                        The farm that my grandfather had always treasured
                        And all of the others buried memories
                         
                        I’m from every moment of those people before me, the seed that falls from great history. This is me.
